            You can help by learning about and practicing the three R's of waste
            management: Reduce, reuse, and recycle! Practicing all three of these
            activities every day is not only important for a healthy environment, but it can also
            be fun too. So let's take a minute right now to learn more about waste and waste
            management, so you can become a key player in making our world a safe and
            healthy place.

        <div class="reduce">
          <p class="content">Reducing is simply creating less waste. It's the best method for keeping the environment clean, so it's the first of the 3 Rs. By reducing, you stop the problem at the source. Making less waste to begin with means there's less waste to clean up. Reducing waste can be as simple as using both sides of a sheet of paper, using ceramic mugs instead of disposable cups, or buying in bulk rather than individually packaged items. The end result for producing less waste is money saved, resources conserved, pollution reduced, and landfill space saved.
          </p>
          <p class="content">The idea is not to generate waste, but to  reduce waste at or near the source of generation (in our homes, businesses, and institutions). Practicing waste reduction and reuse are the best ways to divert the growing volume of waste.</p>

          Reuse
        </div>
        <div class="reuse">
          <p class="content">Reuse is the action or practice of using an item, whether for its original purpose or to fulfill a different function. It should be distinguished from recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products.
            You can "reuse" materials in their original form instead of throwing them away,
            or pass those materials on to others who could use them too! Remember, one
            man's trash is another man's treasure! <br>
           Here are some examples of reuse...</p>
           <ul>
            <li>● Containers can be reused at home or for school projects.</li>
            <li>● Reuse wrapping paper, plastic bags, boxes, and lumber.</li>
            <li>● Give outgrown clothing to friends or charity.</li>
            <li>● Buy beverages in returnable containers.</li>
            <li>● Donate broken appliances to charity or a local vocational school, which can use them. </li>
            <li>● Offer furniture and household items that are no longer needed to people in need, friends, or charity.</li>
            <li>● Sheets of paper that have been used on only one side can be used for note-taking or rough drafts.</li>
            <li>● Old towels and sheets can be cut in small pieces and used for dust cloths.</li>
            <li>● Books and magazines can be donated to schools, public libraries, or nursing homes.</li>
            <li>● Newspapers can be donated to pet stores.</li>
            <li>● Packing materials, such as polystyrene can be saved and reused again for packing.</li>
            <li>● Carry a reusable tote bag or take bags to the store when you go shopping. </li>
            <li>● Old tires can be used in the garden and in the play yard.</li>

                Recycle—don’t just toss everything in the trash. Lots of things (like cans,
                bottles, paper, and cardboard) can be remade into either the same kind of
                thing or new products. Making new items from recycled ones also takes less
                energy and fewer resources than making products from brand new materials.

                Just about anything in your home (or office or school, etc.) that cannot be
                reused CAN be recycled into something else. You'd be amazed what can be
                done with a recycled product! A recycled soda bottle can be made into
                T-shirts, combs, or hundreds of other plastic goods that can be used for many
                years. Even your brand new computer case might be made from ordinary
                recycled plastics. And paper products can take on different forms as well; an
                old phone book or coloring book might become one of your school books or a
                notebook.
