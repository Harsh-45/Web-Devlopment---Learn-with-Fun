        <p class="content">
          An Environment is everything that is around us, which includes both
          living and nonliving things such as soil, water, animals and plants,
          which adapt themselves to their surroundings. It is nature’s gift that
          helps in nourishing life on Earth. The environment plays an important
          role in the existence of life on the planet earth. The word
          Environment is derived from the French word “Environ” which means
          “surrounding.” An ecosystem refers to all the living and non-living
          things present in the environment and it is a foundation of the
          Biosphere, which determines the health of the entire planet earth.
        </p>
        <div class="component">
          <p class="content" style="margin-bottom: 0.3rem">
            In general, the environment consists of the following major
            components.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Biological Component</li>
            <li>Physical Component</li>
            <li>Social Component</li>

          <br />
          <div class="smallHead">Biological Component</div>
          <p class="content">
            The biological component of environment is also termed as biotic
            component.This biological component includes all living things like
            plants, animals and small micro-organisms like bacteria, algae and
            fungi. Biological component interelates with the abiotic component
            of the environment. An example of interactions between biotic and
            abiotic is plants getting their minerals from the soil and making
            food using sunlight.
          </p>
          <div class="smallHead">Physical Component</div>
          <p class="content">
            The physical component refers to the non-living part of the
            environment. These are also called abiotic factors and include air,
            water, soil, climate etc. Physical components can be broadly
            classified into 3 groups – Atmosphere, Hydrosphere and Lithosphere.
            Additionally, scientists also use the term “biosphere” to describe
            the zone of life (or the worldwide sum of ecosystems).
          </p>
          <div class="smallHead">Social Component</div>
          <p class="content">
            The third component of environment is social component. This
            component is mainly consists of various groups of population of
            different living beings like birds, animals, etc. Human is the most
            independent and intelligent living organism. Like all other living
            creatures on earth, man constructs house, prepares food and delivers
            waste materials to the environment.

            Importance of Environment
          </h2>
          <p class="content" style="margin-bottom: 0.31rem">
            We are from the environment, the environment is very important for
            everyone’s life, because life on earth is possible only from the
            environment. All human beings, animals, natural plants, trees and
            plants, weather, climate are all contained within the environment.
            Environment not only works to maintain balance in the climate and
            also provides all the things necessary for life.
          </p>
          <p class="content" style="margin-bottom: 0.31rem">
            On the other hand, where technology and technology have been
            encouraged by science and there has been a lot of development in the
            world, on the other hand they are also responsible for increasing
            environmental pollution. Due to modernization, industrialization and
            increasing use of technology, the environment has been adversely
            affected.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Human beings are cutting trees and plants due to their selfishness
            and playing with the natural resources, due to which the environment
            is being harmed a lot. Not only this, due to some man-made reasons,
            the atmosphere, hydrosphere etc. are being affected, the temperature
            of the earth is increasing and the problem of global warming is
            arising, which is very dangerous for human health. Therefore,
            understanding the importance of environment, we all should cooperate
            in saving our environment.

          Humans and Environment
        </h2>
        <p class="content" style="margin-bottom: 0.31rem">
          People make changes in the environment, too. Many of these changes are
          harmful to living things. Around the world, human activities have
          resulted in air and water pollution. People also have destroyed the
          habitats of many animals. In addition, some scientists believe that
          people’s use of oil, coal, and natural gas has led to a dangerous
          condition called global warming. This is a rise in the temperature of
          Earth’s surface.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Today many people are working to protect the environment. These people
          try to conserve, or save, natural resources. They also try to recycle,
          or reuse, products to avoid waste and pollution.
