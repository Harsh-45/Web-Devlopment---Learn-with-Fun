                    <li class="item">Technoloy:</li>
                    <p class="content">Using appropriate technology is one which is locally adaptable, eco-friendly, resource efficient and culturally suitable. It mostly involves local resources and local labour. Indigenous technologies are more useful, cost-effective and sustainable. Nature is often taken as a model, using the natural conditions of that region as its components. This concept is known as “design with nature”. The technology should use less of resources and should produce minimum waste.</p>
                    <li class="item">Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle Approach:</li>
                    <p class="content">The 3-R approach advocating minimization of resource use, using them again and again instead of passing it on to the waste stream and recycling the materials goes a long way in achieving the goals of sustainability. It reduces pressure on our resources as well as reduces waste generation and pollution.</p>
                    <li class="item">Promoting Environmental Education and Awareness:</li>
                    <p class="content">Making environmental education the centre of all learning process will greatly help in changing the thinking pattern and attitude of people towards our earth and the environment. Introducing subject right from the school stage will inculcate a feeling of belongingness to earth in small children. ‘Earth thinking’ will gradually get incorporated in our thinking and action which will greatly help in transforming our lifestyles to sustainable ones.</p>
                    <li class="item">Resource Utilization as Per Carrying Capacity:</li>
                    <p class="content">Making environmental education the centre of all learning process will greatly help in changing the thinking pattern and attitude of people towards our earth and the environment. Introducing subject right from the school stage will inculcate a feeling of belongingness to earth in small children. ‘Earth thinking’ will gradually get incorporated in our thinking and action which will greatly help in transforming our lifestyles to sustainable ones.</p>
                    <li class="item">Improving Quality of Life Including Social, Cultural and Economic Dimensions:</li>
                    <p class="content">Development should not focus just on one-section of already affluent people. Rather it should include sharing of benefits between the rich and the poor. The tribal, ethnic people and their cultural heritage should also be conserved. Strong community participation should be there in policy and practice. Population growth should be stabilized.

                <div class="img"><img src="../images/sdg.png" alt=""></div>
                <p class="content">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were   adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
                    The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
                    Countries have committed to prioritize progress for those who're furthest behind. The SDGs are designed to end poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls.
                    The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.</p>
