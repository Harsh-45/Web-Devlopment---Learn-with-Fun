                <p>Air pollution is the introduction of foreign products into the atmosphere that have
                    harmful effects on living organisms and cause damage to the environment. Different air pollutants (particles and gases) from factories, vehicle exhausts and burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil etc are released into the air which pollute the air.

                <p>Air pollution has many negative effects on human beings and the environment. Air
                    pollution can cause respiratory diseases and can damage the respiratory system
                    including lungs. It can also cause breathing problems, headaches, eye and throat
                    irritation. Air pollution like Smog (Smoke+Fog) can reduce visibility and cause traffic
                    accidents.Air pollution can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil. This can kill crops or reduce their yield. It can kill young trees and other plants. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide particles in the air, can create acid rain when they mix with water and oxygen in the atmosphere.

                <p>Water pollution is the process which happens when pollutants contaminate water.
                    Contamination of water bodies like lakes, rivers, oceans and groundwater occur when
                    pollutants are discharged directly or indirectly into water bodies without any treatment to
                    remove harmful compounds. Water pollutants from different sources such as farms (pesticides and fertilisers),
                    factories (toxic chemicals, acids, alkalis), hospitals (medicines, syringes, gloves etc) and
                    households (cleaning products, washing soaps and powders, sewage) etc enters into
                    water bodies like underground water, rivers, streams, lakes and eventually the sea
                    causing water pollution.</p>

                <p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth's land surfaces, at and below
                    ground level. Some common sources of land pollution include solid waste or garbage from
                    households and hospitals etc. Waste or sludge from industries or mining activities that is
                    deposited on land is another source of land pollution. Mining activities and pollution
                    caused due to construction or agricultural activities are yet another source of land/soil
                    pollution.

                    breeding grounds for insects causing vector-borne diseases as well as bacteria and
                    viruses causing other diseases. Medical solid waste is hazardous and can be extremely

                <p>Noise pollution, also known as sound pollution and environmental noise, is unwanted, excessive and harmful noise.Noise pollution like other pollutants is also a by- product of industrialization, urbanizations and modern civilization. Broadly speaking , the noise pollution has two sources, i.e. industrial and non- industrial. The industrial source includes the noise from various industries and big machines working at a very high speed and high noise intensity. Non- industrial source of noise includes the noise created by transport/vehicular traffic and the neighborhood noise generated by various noise pollution can also be divided in the categories , namely, natural and manmade. Most leading noise sources will fall into the following categories: roads traffic, aircraft, railroads, construction, industry, noise in buildings, and consumer products.

                <p>Noise pollution adversely affects the lives of millions of people. Studies have shown that there are direct links between noise and health. Problems related to noise include stress related illnesses, high blood pressure, speech interference, hearing loss, sleep disruption, and lost productivity.
